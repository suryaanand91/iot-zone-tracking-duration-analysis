IoT Zone Tracking and Duration Analysis for Automated Invoicing

The project leverages IoT technology to monitor the movement and time spent by tracked assets within designated zones. It utilizes sensors to capture the duration that objects or individuals remain in various predefined zones, using real-time data processing to generate actionable insights for invoicing purposes.

Project Overview

Input: The system starts with a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file, which defines geographical boundaries for each zone, representing areas of interest. Each zone has specific coordinates and can vary in shape and size, enabling flexible deployment across different environments.

Data Collection: IoT-enabled sensors placed on mobile assets or within zones track entries and exits. The sensors provide real-time data on location changes, enabling accurate monitoring of when an asset enters or exits each designated area. The system calculates the total duration spent in each zone by tracking these movements, thereby ensuring precise billing data for each zone.

Data Processing and Output: A processing algorithm aggregates the time data to compute the total duration spent in each zone per asset. The final output is a CSV file that lists each asset, zone, and the total time duration spent. This file is ready for integration into invoicing systems, making it an efficient tool for clients who need to charge based on zone-specific utilization.

Invoicing Application: The system is tailored for businesses that need to track usage time for billing purposes, such as logistics hubs, equipment rentals, and parking management. By automating zone tracking and time calculation, this IoT solution reduces manual work and improves billing accuracy, benefiting both service providers and clients.

Key Benefits
Enhanced Accuracy: The automated tracking minimizes human error, providing a reliable, transparent invoicing basis.
Seamless Data Integration: CSV output allows easy integration with existing invoicing systems, streamlining the billing workflow.
